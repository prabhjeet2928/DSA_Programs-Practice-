getline() -> The getline() function of C++ used to take the user input in multiple lines until the delimiter character found. The getline() function is predefine function whose definition is present in a  <string.h> header file, so to use getline() function in a program, the first step is to include the <string.h> header file. We know that already we have cin object to accept the input from the user but the cin object does not allow we to accept the user input in multiple lines, so to accept input from the input stream in multiple lines or a string until delimiter character is found we can use the getline() function.

custom delimiter -> Mostly we see on excel csv file which is a comma separated file to make an string as a comma separated, then its called custom delimiter. In c++, mostly used in a stringstream library or header file.
