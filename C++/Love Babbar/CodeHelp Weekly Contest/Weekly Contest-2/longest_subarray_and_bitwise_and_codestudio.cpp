/* Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers(ARR) and Q queries.
Query Type-> X: Find the largest index IND such that ARR[1] & ARR[2] & â€¦...ARR[IND] >=X 
For each query, your task is to find out the largest index IND such that the bitwise and of elements in the array ARR from index 1 to IND is greater than equal to X.
Example:-
ARR = [3,7,9,16]
Q = 2
Query 1-> 2 
Query 2-> 3
Answer for the first query is 2. (3 & 7 = 3 >= 2).
Answer for the second query is 3 (3 & 7 & 9 >= 1).

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 5
3 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= Q <= 10^5
1 <= ARR[i] <= 10^9
1 <= X <= 10^9

Time Limit: 1sec

Sample Input :
1
4 2
3 7 9 16
2
1

Sample Output :
2
3

Explanation For Sample Output :
In the first test case, the answer to the first query is 2 as 3 & 7 is 3 which is greater equal to 2. The answer to the second query is 3 as 3 & 7 & 9 is 1 which is greater equal to 1. */
